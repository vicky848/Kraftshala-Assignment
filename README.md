Weather Application with React
This application fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API based on user input and displays it using React components.

Technologies Used
React
JavaScript (ES6+)
CSS for styling
OpenWeatherMap API
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (v14.0 or higher)
npm (v6.0 or higher)
Getting Started
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
cd repository-name
Install dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install
Add API Key

Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
Create a .env file in the root directory.
Add your API key to .env:
plaintext
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Start the development server

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Enter a location in the search bar and click "Get Weather" to fetch weather data for that location.
The weather details (temperature, location, date) will be displayed below the search bar.
If an error occurs (e.g., location not found), an error message will be shown.
Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:

/public: Contains the index.html file.
/src: Contains the React application source code.
/src/App.js: Main component rendering the SearchBar.
/src/components/SearchBar.js: Component handling user input and fetching weather data.
/src/components/WeatherDisplay.js: Component displaying weather information.
/src/index.css: CSS file for styling.
Additional Notes
This application uses fetch to retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Error handling is implemented to manage cases where weather data cannot be fetched.
Styling is managed using CSS, with classes defined in index.css.






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
